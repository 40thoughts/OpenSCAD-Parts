OpenSCAD Parts
==============

After getting bored redesigning every part each time for my projects, I decided to store my future components in this repo to get a simpler way to reuse them.
Also as I wouldn't like you to waste your time on reinventing the wheel, I'd be happy for you to use, share, improve, ..., those components !

The files under the "doc" folders (datasheets, drawings, pictures, ...), are mostly given for reference, I wouldn't follow them at 100% as they can change from one supplier to another. Also, sometimes no one checked the drawings, so as I'm used to work with dozens of datasheets at the same time, I would usually use the most common values.
